"""TradeJournal helper — append-only on-chain log of settled trades.

Settlement frequency in HyperAgent's loop is irregular (whenever a position
closes). To keep gas spend bounded and avoid one-tx-per-trade overhead, we
queue settled trades and flush them as separate `record()` txs at most once
per `MANTLE_FLUSH_INTERVAL` seconds. Each `record()` is its own tx (the
contract's API is single-trade-per-call), but they're submitted in a tight
loop within the flush window so they share the same RPC connection.

Hash format (must match any client reproducing it):
    tradeHash = keccak256(abi.encode(
        string  coin,
        uint256 entry_px_e8,   # entry price * 1e8
        uint256 exit_px_e8,    # exit price * 1e8
        int256  size_e8,       # signed size * 1e8 (positive = long, negative = short)
        uint8   side,          # 0 = buy/long entry, 1 = sell/short entry
        uint64  opened_at,
        uint64  closed_at,
    ))
